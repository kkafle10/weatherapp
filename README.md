## Overview

**Project Title**: Weather by City

**Project Description**: Weather by City is a responsive React web application that allows users to search for live weather data based on any city around the world. It uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather details such as temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, and corresponding weather icon. The app features unit toggle for °F/°C and dynamic rendering based on user input and API responses.

**Project Goals**:

- Learn the basics of React including components, props, and useState
- Handle user input via controlled forms
- Make API requests using `fetch()` with async/await and error handling
- Conditionally render elements based on loading or error state
- Use a 3rd-party npm package (`react-icons`) for better UI
- Organize and style components using custom CSS

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone the repository ""
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd weatherapp`
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

Instructions for using the software:

1. Enter a city name (e.g., "New York") in the input field
2. Click "Get Weather" to fetch data
3. View real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed
4. Use the toggle button to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius
5. Check city and country name displayed with accurate weather icon
